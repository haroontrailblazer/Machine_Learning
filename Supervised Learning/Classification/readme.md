# Classification Algorithms: A Concise Overview

This repository provides a quick summary of 7 foundational supervised learning algorithms used for classification tasks. Whether you're starting out in machine learning or need a refresher, this guide captures the core idea behind each method in plain English.

## Algorithms Covered

### 1. Logistic Regression
Although called a regression method, logistic regression is used for binary or multi-class classification. It estimates the probability of class membership using a sigmoid curve, making it ideal for linear boundaries.

### 2. Decision Tree
A tree-based model that makes splits based on feature values. It’s highly interpretable and can capture non-linear relationships, though it may overfit if not pruned.

### 3. Random Forest
An ensemble of decision trees trained on random data subsets. It combines their predictions (usually via majority voting) to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

### 4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
SVMs find the optimal hyperplane that separates classes in feature space. With kernel functions, they can also model non-linear decision boundaries effectively.

### 5. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
A non-parametric method that classifies an input based on the majority class of its 'k' nearest neighbors. Simplicity is its strength, but performance can degrade with large datasets.

### 6. Naive Bayes
A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' Theorem with the "naive" assumption that all features are independent. It's fast, efficient, and often surprisingly effective on high-dimensional data like text.

### 7. Gradient Boosting Methods (AdaBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)
These iterative ensemble algorithms train models sequentially to correct previous errors. They’re among the most powerful classifiers for structured data but require tuning and care to avoid overfitting.

## Final Thoughts

No single model fits all classification problems. Simpler algorithms like logistic regression and Naive Bayes offer transparency and speed, while ensemble methods like gradient boosting and Random Forest dominate in accuracy and handling complex data. SVMs excel in high-dimensional settings, and KNN provides flexibility in low-resource setups. Choosing the right model depends on the trade-offs you’re willing to make between performance, interpretability, scalability, and complexity. Empirical testing and validation remain essential to discovering what truly works best in a given scenario.
